# Relational Database System Project
## DBMS Project for Relational Database Class: using MySQL, AWS, and Replit

I started off by creating the [complete documentation](https://github.com/KaiserMighty/Drone-Flight-Management-System-Database/blob/main/documentation.pdf) that will define in detail the conceptual design and architecture of my database system. Note that this is a professional document that is read by technical and non-technical people and teams (i,e CEO, CTO, Project Managers, Founders, Engineers, Testers, etc). Reading this document will thoroughly explain the project in detail.

I used the technical info provided in the documentation to build the conceptual design of the database ([Entity Relationship Diagram or ERD](https://github.com/KaiserMighty/Drone-Flight-Management-System-Database/blob/main/erd.drawio)) and to create a detailed description of all the entities in the database in drawio.

I built the database architecture and created a database model ([Enhanced Entity-relationship diagram or EER](https://github.com/KaiserMighty/Drone-Flight-Management-System-Database/blob/main/err.mwb)) of my tables based on my ERD and entity description.

I then went through the forward engineering process to translate my database model (EER) into the [database schema](https://github.com/KaiserMighty/Drone-Flight-Management-System-Database/blob/main/databasemodel.sql) that is used to create the physical database, tables and attributes in my database system.

Lastly, I created a Discord bot (all .py files) that will serve as a bridge interface to serve knowledge between my database system and the end user of my application. The main goal was to transform the data (output from my business rules) into knowledge to meet the user's needs.
